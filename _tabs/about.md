### **Hello, I'm Yaotian (Walter)!**

You can find me with:

- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaotianwei/)
- [Github](https://github.com/ytwei3)
- [CV]()
- Email: `yaotianwei03 at gmail dot com`

I'm currently pursuing my Finance bachelor's degree @ [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). Meanwhile, I have one year of internship experience in research and development @ [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/), as well as real-time trading experience @ [Rotman International Trading Competition (RITC)](https://inside.rotman.utoronto.ca/financelab/competition/ritc/).

You can call me Walter, but I personally always prefer to be addressed by my Chinese name, "Yaotian," for those who are familiar with Chinese.

For the future, I am constantly seeking opportunities to build things that excite me and impact people.
