Hello! I'm Yaotian, currently pursuing my bachelor's degree at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I am a Finance student with one year of experience in research and development at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/), as well as trading experience in the [Rotman International Trading Competition](https://inside.rotman.utoronto.ca/financelab/competition/ritc/) (RITC).

You can call me Walter, but I personally prefer to be addressed by my Chinese name, "Yaotian," for those who are familiar with Chinese.

Looking ahead, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to create impactful and exciting projects that can make a difference in people's lives.
